[x] Make a test call to pplx
[x] Read the pplx docs
[x] Figure out configuration for pplx
[x] Write actual script
[x] Look at full response & figure out which parts of the response are actually useful
[x] Change the program so it outputs to a nicely formatted response log instead of the shell
[x] Engineer the initial prompt
[x] Why won't it list citations? Fix it.
[-] Test and retry until satisfied

[x] Figure out the formatting of the data from the sheet
[-] Use 1st AI to collect data and 2nd AI to format it

OK pplx is inconsistent. 
New plan - 
[-] Try domain filtering
^ This is exclusive to tier 3 users, so scratch that.
Problems with pplx - no domain filtering, can't extract info reliably, doesn't follow prompts, hallucinates.
Gemini has grounding with search but that is paid too.

Options - 
Try Gemini and other AI search tools
Scrape the pages and extract with LLM
Integrate the LLM into the scraping
Find a tool which does most of the work - research

TEST this immediately
s.jina.ai -> get the urls -> r.jina.ai -> llm -> output
^ this looks really promising

Stress test it. I only learn new information when something goes wrong.
Have to search for delivery and returns seperately.

Ask Abbas which AI is optimal for extracting info from a lot of data.
Is Jina ok for us to use? Should we get their pro keys?
Refine prompt, get responses, get feedback from Anshita.

So now - 
[x] jinaSearch to search for links
[ ] jinaFormat to make the pages LLM friendly 
[ ] geminiFormat to get the final response

Try grounding with search on Gemini
Brave API + some filtering
