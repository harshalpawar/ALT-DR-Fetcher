Really solid response. Proper citations. Let's try some other brand.

Any return charges should go in the main section.

Basically simplify the info a lot and make it look like the manually collected sheet.

"Yeah, this confirms what I suspected‚ÄîPerplexity's retrieval behavior is inconsistent. Same prompt, same settings, different results. That means the issue isn't your code‚Äîit's the API itself."
PPLX is searching random domains and hallucinating the answers so I'll have to try domain filtering.
Domain filtering requires a 500$ credit purchase.
I'll have to make something with scraping + LLM. I can discuss the filtering option later.

pplx is no good for extraction + formatting because it doesn't follow instructions and runs searches on top anyway
