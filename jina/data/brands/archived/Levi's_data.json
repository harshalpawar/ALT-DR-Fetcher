It is an offer made by you to purchase the product for the price listed (inclusive of any fees and charges). The offer is made at the time that the order is made, and on these Terms.\n\nIn order to process any orders, we may require additional information from you. Where we do request such information, you must provide accurate, complete and up to date information so that we can confirm the details of the order.\n\nWe reserve the right, without prior notice, to limit the order quantity on any product or service and/or to refuse service to any customer.\n\nYou confirm that the product(s) ordered by you are being purchased for your internal / personal purpose and not for re-sale or business purposes. You authorize us to declare and provide declaration to any governmental authority on your behalf stating the aforesaid purpose of the product(s) ordered by you on our Primary Website.\n\nC) Acceptance Of An Order\n\nAcceptance of the order occurs where:\n\nwe confirm that the product(s) you have ordered are available for delivery;\nthe payment made by you for the product(s) is approved by us and we have debited the amount of the order from your debit or credit card or other payment method (i.e. when the payment is cleared); and\nwe send an email to you with your invoice and tracking information.\n\nIf, for whatever reason, we decide to reject the order placed by you, we will endeavour to inform you of this within a reasonable period after the order is submitted.\n\nD) Pricing And Availability\n\nWe try to ensure that the information provided on our Websites is accurate, up to date and error-free.

You may be required to pay for the delivery charges after the first unsuccessful delivery attempt, if any.\n\nDelivery times are indicative only and are based on estimates indicated by our delivery providers and the typical delivery times experienced by us. At certain times, delivery times may be longer than what is advised (such as in busy periods, including sale and holiday seasons).\n\nWe will only make delivery of a product where we are able to deliver it to a person who can sign for it at the delivery address, or where we have received your express authorisation to leave a product at the delivery address. Where you have provided such an authorisation, you accept the risk of theft, damage or loss of the product from the time and location at which it is delivered.\n\nWhere we cannot deliver the product to a person who can sign for it, and do not have an express authorisation to leave the product at the delivery location, we will leave the product at the post office from where you must collect it within 7 days, after which the product will be returned to us.

A 6-Months warranty backs all Levi's India products against manufacturing and material defects (excluding normal wear and tear).\u00a0\n\nExamples of Manufacturer Defects:\u00a0A manufacturer defect is any irregularity or flaw that goes beyond normal wear and tear. Here are some examples:\n\nStitching Issues:\u00a0Uneven or frayed stitching affecting structural integrity.\nFaulty Zippers or Buttons:\u00a0Malfunctioning closures hindering normal use.\nMisalignment of Pockets:\u00a0Uneven or misaligned pocket sewing.\nIssues with Hardware:\u00a0Problems with rivets, grommets, or metal components.\n\nUnderstanding Jeans Warranty: Small Holes and Wear & Tear\n\nIt's essential to clarify what's covered under our warranty when it comes to small holes that appear over time.\n\nOur warranty is designed to protect against manufacturing defects, such as issues with stitching or material quality. However, normal wear and tear\u2014like small holes from regular use\u2014isn't typically covered under warranty.\n\nHere are more examples of wear and tear that are considered normal with regular use of jeans:\n\nFading:\u00a0Over time, jeans naturally fade due to washing and exposure to sunlight.\nStretching:\u00a0Fabric can stretch with regular wear, especially in areas like the knees and seat.\nAbrasion:\u00a0Friction from everyday use can cause slight abrasion on fabric surfaces.\nMinor Pilling:\u00a0Small balls of fibers may form on the fabric surface, particularly in high-friction areas.\nColor Transfer:\u00a0Some dye from jeans may transfer onto other fabrics, especially when new.\nHem Wear:\u00a0The bottom edge of jeans may show signs of wear or fraying over time.\nBelt Loops:\u00a0Belt loops can wear down with frequent belt use.\n\nHow to Initiate a Warranty Claim:\n\nSend an email to customercare@levi.in. Attach pictures of the defect, size label, country label, and product style label.\nYou will receive an email confirmation when a claim has been received.\nWait 3-4 business days for processing.\n\nWarranty Program Details:\n\nIf we confirm a defect, we'll send you a voucher for a replacement at Levi.in. It's important to keep in mind that the voucher is for one-time use only. Any funds not utilized towards the purchase of your replacement garment are non-refundable.\nNote:\u00a0The voucher will not be replaced if you return or exchange the replacement garment for any reason.\nLost or stolen vouchers won't be replaced.\nOne product per claim, up to six claims every six months. Claims exceeding the limit won't be accepted. LS&CO reserves the right to modify or terminate this policy at any time without notice. Final decisions can't be re-inspected.\n\nPhoto Instructions:\n\nSend at least two clear images of the defect, the size label, and the\u00a0product care label.\nImages must be sharp and clear, and numbers on the size tag must be legible.\n\nPhoto Examples:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe hope this guide makes your warranty claim process easy.

Levi.in reserves the right to deny to reject\u00a0if the item does not meet its\u00a0Policy guidelines.\n\nItems bought on sale will only be valid for exchange.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWARRANTY\n\nAt Levi's, we stand behind the quality of our products and want you to love every purchase. A 6-Months warranty backs all Levi's India products against manufacturing and material defects (excluding normal wear and tear).\u00a0\n\nExamples of Manufacturer Defects:\u00a0A manufacturer defect is any irregularity or flaw that goes beyond normal wear and tear. Here are some examples:\n\nStitching Issues:\u00a0Uneven or frayed stitching affecting structural integrity.\nFaulty Zippers or Buttons:\u00a0Malfunctioning closures hindering normal use.\nMisalignment of Pockets:\u00a0Uneven or misaligned pocket sewing.\nIssues with Hardware:\u00a0Problems with rivets, grommets, or metal components.\n\nUnderstanding Jeans Warranty: Small Holes and Wear & Tear\n\nIt's essential to clarify what's covered under our warranty when it comes to small holes that appear over time.\n\nOur warranty is designed to protect against manufacturing defects, such as issues with stitching or material quality. However, normal wear and tear\u2014like small holes from regular use\u2014isn't typically covered under warranty.\n\nHere are more examples of wear and tear that are considered normal with regular use of jeans:\n\nFading:\u00a0Over time, jeans naturally fade due to washing and exposure to sunlight.\nStretching:\u00a0Fabric can stretch with regular wear, especially in areas like the knees and seat.\nAbrasion:\u00a0Friction from everyday use can cause slight abrasion on fabric surfaces.\nMinor Pilling:\u00a0Small balls of fibers may form on the fabric surface, particularly in high-friction areas.\nColor Transfer:\u00a0Some dye from jeans may transfer onto other fabrics, especially when new.\nHem Wear:\u00a0The bottom edge of jeans may show signs of wear or fraying over time.\nBelt Loops:\u00a0Belt loops can wear down with frequent belt use.\n\nHow to Initiate a Warranty Claim:\n\nSend an email to customercare@levi.in. Attach pictures of the defect, size label, country label, and product style label.\nYou will receive an email confirmation when a claim has been received.\nWait 3-4 business days for processing.\n\nWarranty Program Details:\n\nIf we confirm a defect, we'll send you a voucher for a replacement at Levi.in. It's important to keep in mind that the voucher is for one-time use only. Any funds not utilized towards the purchase of your replacement garment are non-refundable.\nNote:\u00a0The voucher will not be replaced if you return or exchange the replacement garment for any reason.\nLost or stolen vouchers won't be replaced.\nOne product per claim, up to six claims every six months. Claims exceeding the limit won't be accepted. LS&CO reserves the right to modify or terminate this policy at any time without notice. Final decisions can't be re-inspected.\n\nPhoto Instructions:\n\nSend at least two clear images of the defect, the size label, and the\u00a0product care label.\nImages must be sharp and clear, and numbers on the size tag must be legible.\n\nPhoto Examples:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe hope this guide makes your warranty claim process easy. Remember proper care ensures your jeans stay in top condition.\n\nIN-STORE RETURNS AND EXCHANGE\n\nProducts bought on Levi.in cannot be returned or exchanged at our retail stores. Please follow our online return process. Similarly products bought online cannot be returned/exchanged in our retail stores.\n\nQUICK LINKS\n\nMen's Jeans\nWomen\u2019s Jeans\nMen\u2019s T-shirts\nWomen\u2019s Tops\nFootwear\nMen\u2019s Jackets\nRed Tab Member Program\nStore Locator\n\nSUPPORT\n\nHelp\nReturns & Exchanges\nShipping\nAbout Us\n\nCONTACT\n\nFor Customer care\n\ncustomercare@levi.in\n\nFor Order Escalation\n\nfeedbacklevi@levi.in\n\nFor Corporate Orders\n\ncorporatesales@levi.in\n\nFor Online Orders\n\n1800-123-5384\n\nFor Store Queries\n\n1800-1020-501\n\nCall Timings\n\nMon-Sat : 10AM - 6PM\n\nITS ALL ABOUT THE PERKS\n\n*See Details for Terms and Conditions and See Privacy Policy for our privacy practices.\n\nSubscribe\nPayment methods\n\u00a9 2025, Levis India Store\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of use\nReturns\nCorporate Information\nPinterest\nInstagram\nYouTube\nTwitter"
