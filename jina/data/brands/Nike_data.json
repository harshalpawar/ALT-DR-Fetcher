Bear in mind that the address on your documents must match the delivery address for the order or you'll need to provide proof of address in addition to your documents.\n\nWe make clearing your order easy\u2014just enter your Know Your Consumer (KYC) information during checkout.\n\nIf you opt not to enter your information during checkout, your order will be temporarily held. You'll have seven days to provide the required information (we'll send you a few email reminders).\n\nIf we don't receive your information within seven days, or if we're unable to validate the information you provide, we'll automatically cancel the order.\n\nNIKE BY YOU ORDERS\n\nProviding your KYC information works a little differently for orders that include any Nike By You items. In this case, once the custom shoes are ready to be dispatched, the courier for your order will email a secure link so you can confirm your KYC information within 30 days. After you confirm your information, the courier will clear and deliver your order. If we don't receive your information within 30 days, or if we're unable to validate the information you provide, we won't be able to deliver the order and we'll issue you a refund.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat documents do I need to provide to confirm my KYC information?\nIndian citizens can use one of the documents below for verification:\n\nAadhaar card\nVoter ID\nPassport\n\nWhen uploading a copy of your documents, remember to submit copies of the front and back. If you're using your passport for verification, ensure that it's still valid, as expired passports are not accepted.\n\nPlease be aware that regulations require the address on your documents to match your order's delivery address.\n\nI'm a foreign national living in India\u2014how can I confirm my KYC information?\nA passport can be used to confirm your information. Additionally, customs will require proof of your address: a hotel booking receipt, stay visa, rental agreement, or you may provide proof of living with a relative or friend to confirm your address.\n\nWhat if the address on my documents and the delivery address for the order don't match?\nDuring checkout, select \"Address on ID does not match delivery address\" and then submit your proof of residence. You'll need to provide a document that matches the delivery address.\n\nWhat if I didn't submit the correct documents?\nIn this case, your order will be cancelled and we'll send you an order cancellation email.\n\nFor orders with Nike By You items, the courier may get in touch with you for the correct information if it's within 30 days, or your order may be returned to sender. If your order is returned to sender, you won't get an email cancellation, but we'll refund your payment (if payment was collected).\n\nContact Us\nChat with us\n9:00 - 22:00\n7 days a week\nCall us\n000 800 919 0566\n9:00 - 22:00\n7 days a week\nEmail us\nWe'll reply within five business day\nFind a Store\nWe think you are in United States.

So, it makes sense that it can feel overwhelming\u2014and perhaps annoying\u2014when the time comes to replace them. The average running shoe generally lasts between 300 and 500 miles, Carol Mack, DPT, CSCS, previously told Nike. And if you notice blisters on your feet or uneven wear patterns on the soles of your sneakers, it isn't a bad idea to trade in your kicks sooner.\n\nOnce you've found a new pair of running shoes, it's time for the challenging part: helping your feet adapt to them. Wondering how to get started? Read on for step-by-step instructions on how to break in new running shoes and expert-backed advice for making the process as seamless\u2014and painless\u2014as possible.\n\n(RELATED: Shop for running shoes like a pro)\n\nWhy it's important to break in running shoes\n\nA break-in period with new running shoes allows the feet and lower legs to adjust to a stiffer-than-usual sneaker slowly and safely. \"New shoes are less flexible than old ones and reduce the range of motion throughout the footstrike\", explains Sean Fortune, a New York City-based USATF Level II running coach. \"These mechanics increase the risk of injury by putting excess stress on the foot and lower leg\".\n\nAccording to Fortune, potential injuries range from mild to severe and include blisters and foot cramps, plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendonitis, which he's experienced from logging too many miles in new running shoes.\n\nAshley Campbell, a lead product line manager at Nike, adds that the break-in period is especially important if you're running in a type of shoe you've never trained in before, such as a racing shoe or a sneaker with less support than what you're used to. \"A new shoe that has an unfamiliar feel to you may slightly change the way you run through stride or footstrike. So, it's important to allow your body to adapt to mitigate soreness or injury\", she says.\n\nShop Nike Running Shoes\nView All\nNike Pegasus Premium\nMen's Road Running Shoes\nMRP : \u20b9 19 295.00\nNike Pegasus Premium\nWomen's Road Running Shoes\nMRP : \u20b9 19 295.00\nNike Pegasus Premium\nMen's Road Running Shoes\nMRP : \u20b9 19 295.00\nNike Vomero 18\nMen's Road Running Shoes\nMRP : \u20b9 13 295.00\nNike Vomero 18\nMen's Road Running Shoes\nMRP : \u20b9 13 295.00\nNike Vomero 18\nWomen's Road Running Shoes\nMRP : \u20b9 13 295.00\nNike Vomero 18\nMen's Road Running Shoes\nMRP : \u20b9 13 295.00\nNike Vomero 18\nWomen's Road Running Shoes\nMRP : \u20b9 13 295.00\nNike Vomero 18\nWomen's Road Running Shoes\nMRP : \u20b9 13 295.00\nNike Vaporfly 4\nMen's Road Racing Shoes\nMRP : \u20b9 21 495.00\nHow to break in new running shoes\n\nYou know by now that it's important to break in your new shoes before logging any serious mileage. But how exactly should you go about it\u2014and how long does it take to break in running shoes? According to Bruce Pinker, DPM, a board-certified podiatrist and foot surgeon, new shoes should be sufficiently broken in after about 5 to 10 miles of wear, give or take. \"It's not the same for everyone. The condition of one's feet, as well as the footwear construction, need to be considered\", Pinker says.\n\n\"Nike running sneakers tend to be crafted from softer materials and have a good amount of flexibility, so the break-in period is minimal\u2014as little as two or three runs\", Campbell says. However, it's always best to follow a more formal break-in process, which may vary from person to person. Runners with foot conditions like plantar fasciitis, for example, may need to spend additional time in their shoes before they're sufficiently broken in. While those without any foot concerns who are breaking in shoes with a flexible construction may require less time, Pinker explains.\n\nHere are the steps you should take during the first handful of miles to help your feet start feeling at home in your new kicks:\n\nWear your shoes around the house\n\nGo about your daily routine at home while wearing your new shoes, and gradually increase the time you spend wearing them, Fortune suggests. Start with an hour or two and work your way up to wearing them for longer stretches of time. This slow transition will help you break in your sneakers while keeping the soles clean in case you decide they're not for you and you need to return them.\n\nThis step, which should last about a week, is especially important if you purchase the shoes online without trying them on first. If you develop blisters, feel pain or discomfort, or your foot continuously slips out of the shoe, return them. Nike will issue a refund or store credit for sneakers that don't have major signs of wear.\n\nBend the toe box\n\nOnce you've decided to keep your shoes, Fortune recommends bending the toe box four or five times so the sole becomes creased. This bending softens the material, making it feel less rigid underfoot.\n\nTry some short runs\n\nAfter a week of wearing your sneakers at home, it's time to give them a true test-drive by picking up the pace. Fortune suggests doing a few short, easy runs in your new sneakers (reduce your typical distance by half) and wearing your older sneakers for long runs. Research shows that alternating your old sneakers with your new ones for several weeks can help ward off running-related injuries. Pinker says this is especially true for long-distance runners, while weekend joggers may only need to follow this routine for about a week before they can exclusively work out in their new sneakers.\n\nTransition to your typical routine\n\nSlowly transition to your typical mileage in your new sneakers. \"If your feet or legs begin to hurt, listen to your body, stop running and resume the break-in process\", Pinker says.\n\nWhile this may seem tedious, it's worth it to be patient. Research shows a slow transition can help prevent muscle soreness and injury.\n\nShop Nike running accessories & equipment\nView All\nNike Dri-FIT ADV Fly\nUnstructured AeroBill AeroAdapt Cap\nMRP : \u20b9 2 295.00\nNike Apex\nDri-FIT Bucket Hat\nMRP : \u20b9 1 995.00\nNike Dri-FIT Apex\nBucket Hat\nMRP : \u20b9 1 995.00\nNike Rise\nDri-FIT Trucker Cap\nMRP : \u20b9 1 295.00\nNike Dri-FIT ADV Fly\nUnstructured AeroBill AeroAdapt Cap\nMRP : \u20b9 2 295.00\nNike Dri-FIT ADV Club\nStructured Swoosh Cap\nMRP : \u20b9 1 595.00\nNike Ace\nDri-FIT Visor\nMRP : \u20b9 995.00\nNike Spark Lightweight\nRunning Ankle Socks\nMRP : \u20b9 895.00\nNike Spark Lightweight\nRunning Ankle Socks\nMRP : \u20b9 895.00\nNike\nTrail-Running Crew Socks (1 Pair)\nMRP : \u20b9 1 395.00\nAdditional tips and tricks\n\nOverall, breaking in new running shoes should be straightforward and painless. But sometimes, questions come up along the way. These tips and tricks may prove helpful:\n\nPick the right size shoe\n\n\"The fit of a running shoe should not be distracting and should feel like an extension of your foot\", Campbell says. If your shoes cause blisters, pinch your toes or feel too tight in the heel, they might not be the right size or shoe type for you. \"A shoe that's the correct size should have 1cm (approx.) of space between the longest toe and the end of the shoe and should fit snugly width-wise but not feel tight\", Pinker says. If your shoe is too small, return it. It's always better to opt for a larger running shoe if you fall somewhere between sizes.\n\nWear the correct socks\n\nIf your new sneakers feel generally OK, but the fit feels slightly off, consider trying a different pair of socks. \"It's a good idea to try a variety of socks of different thicknesses to see which best fits your foot and running shoe\", Fortune says. \"I have thinner ones for my racing shoes, which fit a little tighter, and thicker socks for my sneakers that fit a little bigger\".\n\nMaterials are also important to consider in addition to sock thickness. Pinker generally recommends socks that are a blend of cotton and polyester or another synthetic like nylon, rayon or Lycra. The cotton provides cushioning while the synthetics wick away moisture from the foot, which can help prevent common foot conditions, such as athlete's foot fungus, toenail fungus and plantar warts, he explains.\n\n(RELATED: How to choose the best socks for running)\n\nShop Nike Running Socks\nView All\nNike Spark Lightweight\nRunning Crew Socks\nMRP : \u20b9 895.00\nNike Multiplier\nRunning Ankle Socks (2 Pairs)\nMRP : \u20b9 895.00\nNike Multiplier\nRunning No-Show Socks (2 Pairs)\nMRP : \u20b9 895.00\nNike\nTrail-Running Ankle Socks (1 Pair)\nMRP : \u20b9 1 395.00\nNike Spark Lightweight\nRunning Ankle Socks\nMRP : \u20b9 895.00\nNike\nTrail-Running Crew Socks (1 Pair)\nMRP : \u20b9 1 395.00\nNike Spark Lightweight\nNo-Show Running Socks\nMRP : \u20b9 895.00\n\nWords by Dana Leigh Smith\n\nOriginally published: 20 May 2024\n\nRelated Stories\nProduct care\nHow to lace running shoes\nProduct care\nHow to remove odour from shoes\nProduct news\nNike Pegasus Premium reimagines running on air\nBuying guide\nWaterproof Running Gear for Rainy-Day Runs\nBuying guide\nThe best Nike waterproof running shoes\nResources\n\nFind A Store\n\nBecome A Member\n\nSend Us Feedback\n\nHelp\n\nGet Help\n\nOrder Status\n\nDelivery\n\nReturns\n\nPayment Options\n\nContact Us On Nike.com Inquiries\n\nContact Us On All Other Inquiries\n\nCompany\n\nAbout Nike\n\nNews\n\nCareers\n\nInvestors\n\nSustainability\n\nReport a Concern\n\nIndia\n\n\u00a9 2025 Nike, Inc.
