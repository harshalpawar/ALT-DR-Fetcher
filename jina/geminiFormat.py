üìå **RESPONSE FORMAT (Strictly follow this structure):**
**Delivery:**
- Delivery Charges: Rs. X; Free over Rs. Y (or "Free shipping" if applicable)
- Estimated Delivery Time: A-B days

**Returns:**
- Return Period: X days
- Return Method: Brand pickup / Self-ship **Mention the return pickup charges if any**.
- Refund Mode: Bank a/c / Store credit / Other

üîπ **Important Simplification Rules:**
- **Delivery Charges:** If there is a free shipping threshold, write as: "Delivery Charges: Rs. X; Free over Rs. Y".
- **Delivery Time:** If metro and non-metro times are different, merge them into a single range (e.g., "2-5 days" + "5-7 days" ‚Üí "2-7 days").
- **Return Methods:**
  - If the brand arranges a pickup, even if they use terms like **"scheduled courier pickup" or "reverse logistics service"**, treat it as **"Brand pickup"**. **Mention the return pickup charges if any**.
  - If the customer **must ship the item themselves** using their own courier or by dropping it at a store/courier location, classify it as **"Self-ship"**.
  - If returns are **only for exchanges**, format as: "X days - exchanges only; Self-ship".
- **Refund Mode:** If refunds are to a bank account, state "Refund in bank a/c". If store credit is used, state "Refund as store credit".
- **No unnecessary details** should be included. Keep only what's relevant.
- Do **not** make up information‚Äîreturn 'Not specified' for missing details.

Ensure **clarity and structured formatting** as per the above rules.
