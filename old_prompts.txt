Prioritize the official website ({brand["url"]}) as the main source. If the required details are missing, supplement with other **reliable sources**â€”but ensure they are **India-specific** whenever possible.

ðŸ“Œ **Important Guidelines:**

- If India's official website does not contain the full policy, **only use supplementary sources that are directly relevant to India** (e.g., Indian customer service pages, official FAQs, press releases).  
- **Ensure accuracy and factual correctness**â€”do **not** make assumptions.  
- **Follow the response format strictly**, and include an **'Additional Information'** section for anything relevant that does not fit neatly into the structured response.

ðŸ”¹ **Important Simplification Rules:**
- **Delivery Charges:** If there is a free shipping threshold, write as: "Delivery Charges: Rs. X; Free over Rs. Y".
- **Delivery Time:** If delivery time for different locations are different, merge them into a single range (e.g., "2-5 days" + "5-7 days" â†’ "2-7 days").
- **Return Methods:**
  - If the brand arranges a pickup, even if they use terms like **"scheduled courier pickup" or "reverse logistics service"**, treat it as **"Brand pickup"**.
  - If the customer **must ship the item themselves** using their own courier or by dropping it at a store/courier location, classify it as **"Self-ship"**.
  - If returns are **only for exchanges**, format as: "X days - exchanges only; Self-ship".
- **Refund Mode:** If refunds are to a bank account, state "Refund in bank a/c". If store credit is used, state "Refund as store credit".
- **No unnecessary details** should be included. Keep only what's relevant.

Ensure **clarity and structured formatting** as per the above rules.
