- Delivery Charges: (Free / Free above Rs. X / Standard rate Rs. Y)
- Estimated Delivery Time: (Range of days)

**Returns:**
- Return Period: (X days)
- Return Method: (Self-shipping / In-store return / Brand pickup)
- Refund Mode: (Bank account / Brand wallet / Store credit)

**Additional Information:**
List any relevant policies not covered above, such as exchange policies, late return fees, 
restocking fees, membership benefits, special conditions, or return restrictions.

üîπ **Important Notes:**
- Extract only **factual details** from official sources.
- If multiple policies exist (e.g., COD vs. prepaid), specify both.
- If the **brand URL does not provide full info**, supplement using the best available web sources.
- Do **not** make up information‚Äîreturn 'Not specified' for missing details.

üìå **Important Guidelines:**
- **Use the India website first** ({brand["url"]}).  
- **Do not use international sources** (e.g., .uk, .us, .sg) unless no India-specific information is available.  
- If India's official website does not contain the full policy, **only use supplementary sources that are directly relevant to India** (e.g., Indian customer service pages, official FAQs, press releases).  
- **Ensure accuracy and factual correctness**‚Äîdo **not** make assumptions.  
- **Follow the response format strictly**, and include an **'Additional Information'** section for anything relevant that does not fit neatly into the structured response.
