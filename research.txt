System Prompt
You can use the system prompt to provide instructions related to style, tone, and language of the response. The real-time search component of our models does not attend to the system prompt.

User Prompt
You should use the user prompt to pass in the actual query for which you need an answer for. The user prompt will be used to kick off a real-time web search to make sure the answer has the latest and the most relevant information needed.

ðŸ“Œ **RESPONSE FORMAT (Strictly follow this structure):**
**Delivery:**
- Delivery Charges: Rs. X; Free over Rs. Y (or "Free shipping" if applicable)
- Estimated Delivery Time: A-B days

**Returns:**
- Return Period: X days
- Return Method: Brand pickup / Self-ship
- Refund Mode: Bank a/c / Store credit / Other

ðŸ”¹ **Important Simplification Rules:**
- **Delivery Charges:** If there is a free shipping threshold, write as: "Delivery Charges: Rs. X; Free over Rs. Y".
- **Delivery Time:** If metro and non-metro times are different, merge them into a single range (e.g., "2-5 days" + "5-7 days" â†’ "2-7 days").
- **Return Methods:**
  - If the brand arranges a pickup, even if they use terms like **"scheduled courier pickup" or "reverse logistics service"**, treat it as **"Brand pickup"**.
  - If the customer **must ship the item themselves** using their own courier or by dropping it at a store/courier location, classify it as **"Self-ship"**.
  - If returns are **only for exchanges**, format as: "X days - exchanges only; Self-ship".
- **Refund Mode:** If refunds are to a bank account, state "Refund in bank a/c". If store credit is used, state "Refund as store credit".
- **No unnecessary details** should be included. Keep only what's relevant.
- If the **brand URL does not provide full info**, supplement using the best available India-specific sources.
- Do **not** make up informationâ€”return 'Not specified' for missing details.

Ensure **clarity and structured formatting** as per the above rules.
"""
If Perplexity wonâ€™t reliably pull from the brand site, we stop relying on it for search and instead:

Manually or programmatically get the correct URL for each brandâ€™s returns/delivery page.
Scrape that page directly for content.
Pass that content to Perplexity (or another LLM) just for formatting.
