The way to return an online order made from the store depends on how you have made the payment:

*   If you have paid for your order at the **store till** and you want to make a return, you have to go to a Zara store to manage it.

REFUNDS
=======

Once we have processed the return of your items, we will proceed with the refund.

REFUND OF AN IN-STORE PURCHASE

If you have returned an item purchased in a store, the refund will be made to the same payment method used for the purchase.

If a refund to the original payment method is not possible, our store staff will advise you of an alternative method.

REFUND OF AN ONLINE PURCHASE

When you return an online purchase, you will receive a refund of your order in the same payment method you used for the purchase.

For orders **paid by cash on delivery**, the refund will be made by bank transfer once payment confirmation has been received.

If you wish to be refunded in cash, you may also request your refund in any of our stores. Please consider that the payment confirmation generally takes a minimum of 5 working days.

Please also note that, if you enter your bank details during the return request, all the refunds related to this order will be done only through bank transfer.

If you have sent your return via a carrier, we’ll process it within 72 hours after receiving it at our facilities.

Once the return has been made, we will send you an email with confirmation.

Please note that once the return has been made, you will receive the amount in a maximum of 14 days depending on your bank.

If more than 14 days have passed and you have not received the refund in your account, please use this confirmation to submit it to your bank so that they can help you speed up the process.

You can find more information about the Return and Exchange Policy and the right of withdrawal in our [Purchase Conditions](https://static.zara.net/static//pdfs/IN/terms-and-conditions/terms-and-conditions-en_IN-20241112.pdf).

**Remember:** If you have sent the items to us for return using our home collection service, the costs of the return will be deducted from the amount of your refund.

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

### WHY HAVEN’T I RECEIVED MY REFUND CONFIRMATION EMAIL?

If you have not received the email with your refund information, please check that the email address linked with your purchase is correct.

Please note that if you are returning items using our home collection service, the return will be processed once the goods arrive at our premises. Once completed, you will receive an email with the details of the return.

### WHY MY COD ORDER HAS NOT BEEN REFUNDED CASH AT THE STORE?

If you paid by cash on delivery but could not receive cash from the store it could be due to several reasons.

Because you have already made a request for a refund by bank transfer for this purchase order.

Because we have not yet received confirmation of your payment. Please consider that the payment confirmation generally takes a minimum of 5 working days.

Alternatively, bank transfer will remain available as a refund method at the store.

### I NO LONGER HAVE THE CARD I USED TO MAKE THE PURCHASE. HOW WILL I RECEIVE MY REFUND?

Refunds are always processed to the same payment method used for the order. If you no longer have the card used for the purchase, we suggest that you contact your bank so that they can help you.

### I NO LONGER HAVE THE GIFT CARD I USED TO PAY. WHERE WILL I RECEIVE MY REFUND?

If the return is for an online purchase, along with the email confirming the return, you will receive a virtual copy of that card with the updated balance.

If you are returning a physical store purchase, our store staff will issue the refund on an e-voucher.

### WHY HAVE I RECEIVED A PARTIAL REFUND FOR MY RETURN?

Please note that if you have sent us the items in several boxes, we will be able to process the return at different times. We will send you an email confirming the details of each one.

If you prefer, you can contact us so that we can review your case in detail.

### HOW CAN I GET THE INVOICE FOR MY REFUND?

You can access the invoice for your refund in the details of your order. If you have made the purchase as a guest, you can do so from the link that you will find in the email confirming your return.

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

### WHY CAN'T I SELECT CASH ON DELIVERY TO PAY MY ORDER?

At Zara.com we accept several payment methods. Available payment methods may vary at checkout. If you have a high number of returns or rejections, the Cash on Delivery method will not be available for you. In the event you improve your return or rejection patterns, this payment option will be available for you again.

### WHEN WILL I BE CHARGED FOR MY ORDER?

The payment will be charged when you complete your order. If you have selected COD/POD as the payment method, it will be charged upon delivery.

### HOW CAN I PAY WITH A CARD OR VOUCHER RECEIPT?

If after a return we provide you with a Card or a Voucher Receipt with the amount of the refund, you can use it to place an order. You have to select "Gift Card" as payment method and enter the corresponding number.

### CAN I APPLY A DISCOUNT CODE TO MY PURCHASE?

At Zara, we do not have any discount codes. Subscribe to our _Newsletter_ to keep up to date with all our promotions.

### CAN I PAY FOR MY PURCHASES IN INSTALMENTS?

Payment in instalments depends on the conditions associated with the card with which you make the purchase.

### THE AMOUNT OF MY PURCHASE WAS CHARGED TWICE. WHAT CAN I DO?

Some banks may show both a pre-authorisation and the actual subsequent charge. This amount will be automatically released. If this does not happen, we recommend that you contact your bank to expedite the release of the pre-authorisation.

### HOW CAN I PAY FOR AN ONLINE ORDER PLACED AT A STORE?

At the time of purchase our staff will inform you about the options available in that store to pay for your order:

*   **From the device** on which the purchase has been made.
*   **At the store till.** You have 2 hours to make the payment. If you don’t make the payment at the till, the order will be cancelled.
*   **Cash on delivery (COD)**.

Please note that the availability of these options may vary depending on the Zara store you visit.
